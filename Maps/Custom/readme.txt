How to add my cool custom map?

 1.) Look at \tools\bf_tools\bf_brutelizemap.zip (inside mod package, there is readme.md inside too), 
		thats a map converter that makes your map compatibile with Brute Force by simple drag and drop. 
 
 2.) After conversion move or copy your map to Command & Conquer Red Alert II\Maps\Custom\ folder
 
	- (important!) if your map has other file extension (.yrm for example) change it to .map
	- (optional) sometimes map name (inside map file) must be identical as map filename
	- (optional) using FinalAlert2 or Notepad++ to edit map manually is recommended
