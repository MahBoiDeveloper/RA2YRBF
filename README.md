Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge: Brute Force Mod

***********************************************************************
	   ** Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge - Brute Force Beta **
Version: 0.8.08
***********************************************************************
**Installation:**

- Download, unzip, copy files into the game directory
- Use *BFLauncher.exe* to start the game

This mod requires a clean installation of Red Alert 2 and the Yuri's Revenge expansion pack to play.
Ensure your game is updated to version 1.001 before installation.
Works well with the EA and Steam version.


***********************************************************************
**Important:**

- Use *BFLauncher.exe* to run the mod
- Yuri is the main opponent, you should play against him
- Brute Force is still in the beta phase, which means bugs, glitches and crashes will occur
- Each included tool from tools folder comes with its own readme file
- If you are not installing for the first time but updating the Brute Force mod
  use bf_uninstaller.bat from \tools\bf_tools\bf_uninstaller.zip first (readme included)
  then install the mod

***********************************************************************
**Notes:**

- The overall performance depends on your CPU, as the game engine utilizes only one core. 
  Factors that affect FPS in the game includes the map (pathfinding), the number of AI players, and difficulty settings. 
  If you're experiencing performance issues, try using simpler maps (included), fewer AI players, or lower difficulty settings. 
  I'm continually working on optimization tweaks.

**FAQ:**

- Q: does it have its own campaign?

  A: Not yet, but it will have one in the future

- Q: I just installed this mod but it will not start because it says the MSVCP140.dll and another two .dll is missing.

  A: You need to install Latest supported Visual C++ Redistributable by Microsoft, both x64 and x86 versions.

- Q: I think something's wrong with the tech advancement, cause I'm not able to build a War Factory, or any further buildings. 
     Just Power - Barracks - Refinery - Tech Oil Derrick .. and that's it.

  A: You only have access to basic units. To get better stuff, look for scattered supply packs that contain random buildings, units, and bonuses.

- Q: I can't play as Yuri

  A: Yes, you can't, Yuri is meant to be main AI opponent in this mode, however Freemind Army may come in the future

- Q: How do add my custom map?

  A: Look at \tools\bf_brutelizemap.zip there is readme.md inside, then you'd have to add it to \Maps\Custom\ folder in .map format
     - Map name (inside map file) must be identical as map filename!
