Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge: Brute Force Mod

***********************************************************************
	   ** Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge - Brute Force Beta **
Version: 0.7.85
***********************************************************************
**Installation:**

- Download, unzip, copy files from RA2YRBF-main folder into the game directory
- (optional) Use *cnc-ddraw config.exe* to match your visual preferences
- Use *BF_LAUNCHER.exe* or *BF_LAUNCHER.bat* to start the game

This mod requires a clean installation of Red Alert 2 and the Yuri's Revenge expansion pack to play.
Ensure your game is updated to version 1.001 before installation.
Works well with the EA version.


***********************************************************************
**Important:**

- Use *BF_LAUNCHER.exe* or *BF_LAUNCHER.bat* to run the mod
- Yuri is the main opponent, you should play against him
- Brute Force is still in the beta phase, which means bugs, glitches and crashes will occur
- Each included tool from tools folder comes with its own readme file


***********************************************************************
**Notes:**

- In some cases, you may need to configure your visuals first using cnc-ddraw config.exe
- If you prefer not to or if the .exe launcher doesn't work for you, you can potentially 
  improve performance by adjusting the affinity and priority of the gamemd.exe process in Windows Task Manager. 
  The bf_launcher.exe does this by default.
- The overall performance depends on your CPU, as the game engine utilizes only one core. 
  Factors that affect FPS in the game includes the map (pathfinding), the number of AI players, and difficulty settings. 
  If you're experiencing performance issues, try using simpler maps (included), fewer AI players, or lower difficulty settings. 
  I'm continually working on optimization tweaks.
